This project uses ESP32 combined with DHT11 sensor to collect real-time temperature and humidity data, then send the data to MQTT server. The data is displayed visually on the web interface via WebSocket. The backend is built with Node.js.

Required hardware: ESP32-DHT11

Next, connect the hardware and upload the code to the ESP32_DHT11 folder (Note to edit the code part ... including wifi and server + topic mqtt)

Go to the server_run folder, configure the .env file for the correct data type and start running the .exe file
